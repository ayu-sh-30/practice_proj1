          <h1>Early life and education</h1>
          <p>
            Batra was born on 9 September 1974 in a small town in Palampur,
            Himachal Pradesh to a Punjabi Hindu family. He was the third child
            of Girdhari Lal Batra, a government school principal, and Kamal
            Kanta Batra, a school teacher. He was the elder of twin sons, born
            fourteen minutes before his brother, Vishal. The twins were
            nicknamed: 'Luv' (Vikram) and 'Kush' (Vishal), after the twin sons
            of the Hindu deity Rama, by their mother who was a professed devotee
            of Rama.[1] He had two sisters: Seema and Nutan.[2] As a young
            child, Batra received his primary education under the tutelage of
            his mother.[3][4] He then attended the D.A.V. Public School in
            Palampur, where he studied up to middle standard.[3] He received his
            senior secondary education at Central School in Palampur.

          <h1>Military Career</h1>
          <p>
            Batra joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehradun, in June
            1996 in the Manekshaw Battalion. After completing his 19-month
            training course, he graduated from the IMA on 6 December 1997 and
            was commissioned as a lieutenant into the Indian Army. He was
            commissioned into the 13th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles
            (13 JAK Rif). After commissioning, he was sent to Jabalpur, Madhya
            Pradesh for regimental training. The training lasted one month, from
            December 1997 to the end of January 1998.<br /><br />
            On completion of this training he got his first posting at Sopore in
            Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir, an area with significant
            militant activity. In mid-March 1998, he was sent to the Infantry
            School at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, where young Army officers are
            trained, for the Young Officer's Course. This training lasted five
            months until September 1998. Following completion of the course and
            being awarded alpha grading, he joined his battalion in Sopore in
            October 1998.<br /><br />

            <br /><br />
            During his posting in Sopore, Batra had several encounters with
            militants. In one of those encounters when Batra was leading an
            ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he escaped
            when bullet fired by a militant grazed his shoulder and struck one
            of Batra's men behind him, who was killed. Batra ordered his men to
            fire on the militants, and by morning all of the militants were
            killed. He believed that the bullet was meant for him and not his
            colleague.<br /><br />
            In January 1999, Batra was sent on a Commando Course at Belgaum,
            Karnataka. The course lasted for two months and at the end of it, he
            was awarded the highest grading — the Instructor's Grade.<br /><br />
            Every time when he came home to Palampur on leave, he would visit
            the Neugal Cafe. Batra last came home on leave from the army in
            1999, during the Holi festival for a few days.<br /><br />

            The town of Dras, the second coldest inhabited place in the world
            after Siberia, where temperatures fall as low as −60 degrees Celsius
            in winter. After his leave, he returned to join his battalion in
            Sopore. The 13 JAK Rif, after completing its counter-insurgency
            operations tenure in Kashmir under 192 Mountain Brigade of 8
            Mountain Division, received orders to proceed to Shahjahanpur, Uttar
            Pradesh. The battalion's advance party under Major Yogesh Kumar
            Joshi had reached its destination, when on 5 June, because of the
            outbreak of the war, its deployment orders were changed and the
            battalion received orders to move to Dras. <br /><br />Batra
            informed his parents about his movement and assured them they need
            not worry about him. He would call his parents at least once in ten
            days. The last phone call he made was on 29 June 1999. This was the
            last time that Batra spoke to his mother.<br /><br />
            Beginning his service as a lieutenant, he rose to the rank of
            Captain.
